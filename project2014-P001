#I take the entry of the first three numbers off a resistor and return it's value.

# This is a list for the tens digit of the code
Tens=[0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90]

# This is a list for the colors on the resistor
Color=["Black","Brown","Red","Orange","Yellow","Green","Blue","Violet","Gray","White"]

#This list is the multipliers for the resistor
